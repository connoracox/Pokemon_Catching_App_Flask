# lay out the Available Pokemon page to have cards for each of the first 100 pokemon

# query into the PokeAPI to pull out the first 100 Pokemon and add them to our ElephantSQL page

# Look in notes on how to query the API to do this (Dylan mentioned for loop)

# use a range loop to populate the 100 cards on your Available Pokemon page

# have a button on each card to select the pokemon 

# add that Pokemon to Your Pokemon page

# this is similar to adding a post to your profile in Fakebook example
